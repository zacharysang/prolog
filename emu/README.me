# EMu (Elevator Music): A project to generate generic music

## About
This is a project that is testing the assumption that using a state machine, simple music can be produced.

## Approach
* Use prolog to write a state machine with reasonable rules about transitions between notes
* Write a utility that can translate the notes produced by these rules to an audio file (reach goal: be able to stream this)
